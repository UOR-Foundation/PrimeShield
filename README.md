## Overview

PrimeShield is a novel quantum-resistant cryptographic library built on the mathematical foundations of the Prime Framework. By leveraging intrinsic prime factorization and fiber algebra properties, PrimeShield provides lightweight encryption solutions particularly suited for resource-constrained environments facing the emerging quantum threat.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Resistance**: Based on mathematical structures resistant to quantum algorithms
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Optimized for resource-constrained environments
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Built on the Prime Framework's unique approach to number theory
- **Flexible Security Levels**: Configurable parameters to balance security and performance

## The Prime Framework Advantage

The Prime Framework offers a unique approach to cryptography by embedding natural numbers in Clifford algebras where they factor uniquely into intrinsic primes. This mathematical structure provides several advantages over traditional approaches:

1. **Intrinsic Structure vs. Imposed Hardness**: Security derives from inherent mathematical properties rather than externally imposed computational problems
2. **Multi-base Coherence**: Numbers are represented in all bases simultaneously, creating an exponentially harder problem for attackers
3. **Dimensional Advantage**: Cryptographic operations occur in high-dimensional spaces where quantum algorithms lose their advantage
4. **Self-validating Properties**: The coherence inner product provides built-in validation with minimal overhead


For development installations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/PrimeShield.git
cd PrimeShield
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from primeshield import PrimeShield, PrimeShieldParameters

# Generate cryptographic parameters
params = PrimeShieldParameters.generate(security_level=128)

# Create PrimeShield instance
shield = PrimeShield(params)

# Generate a key pair
private_key, public_key = shield.generate_keypair()

# Encrypt a message
message = "Hello, quantum-resistant world!"
ciphertext = shield.encrypt(public_key, message.encode())

# Decrypt the message
decrypted = shield.decrypt(private_key, ciphertext)
print(decrypted.decode())  # "Hello, quantum-resistant world!"
```

## Security Considerations

PrimeShield's security is based on the hardness of:

1. **Intrinsic Prime Factorization Problem (IPFP)**: Finding the unique intrinsic prime factors of an embedded number
2. **Coherence Norm Minimization Problem (CNMP)**: Minimizing the coherence norm in a high-dimensional space
3. **Prime Operator Spectral Gap Problem (POSGP)**: Determining spectral properties of the Prime Operator

These problems are conjectured to remain hard even for quantum computers due to their high-dimensional space characteristics and non-linear structure.

## Technical Details

### Core Components

- **Clifford Algebra Implementation**: Provides the algebraic structure for embedding numbers
- **Reference Manifold**: Defines the geometric arena for cryptographic operations
- **Universal Number Embedding**: Maps natural numbers to multivectors in the Clifford algebra
- **Intrinsic Prime Factorization**: Factorizes embedded numbers into intrinsic primes
- **Prime Operator**: Encodes the divisor structure of natural numbers and defines the zeta function

### Performance

PrimeShield is designed for efficient operation on constrained devices:

| Operation | Performance | Memory Usage |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Key Generation | O(λ²) | O(λ) |
| Encryption | O(λ log λ) | O(λ) |
| Decryption | O(λ log λ) | O(λ) |

Where λ is the security parameter.
